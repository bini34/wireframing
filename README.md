## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the structure, layout, and functionality of a digital product (such as a website or mobile application).  
It acts as a blueprint, focusing on **user flow, content placement, and interface elements** without the distraction of colors, fonts, or detailed design.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing plays a critical role in the design process because it:

- **Clarifies Ideas**: Helps designers, developers, and stakeholders align on the productâ€™s structure before diving into detailed design.
- **Saves Time & Resources**: Identifies potential usability issues early, reducing costly changes later in development.
- **Improves Collaboration**: Provides a shared visual language for teams to discuss functionality and user experience.
- **Focuses on User Experience**: Ensures that the layout supports intuitive navigation and meets user needs.

Wireframing is an essential step that bridges the gap between brainstorming and high-fidelity design, laying the foundation for a successful digital product.
